        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions ❓</h2>
        <hr>
        <pre style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size:medium;">
Can I freeze the cookie dough?
      Yes!You can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Roll it into balls and freeze them on a baking sheet, then store them in a freezer bag.
How can I make the cookies thicker?
      Chill the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking. This helps the cookies hold their shape and prevents them from spreading too much.
What if I don't have brown sugar?
      You can substitute granulated sugar with 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of molasses to make your own brown sugar.
